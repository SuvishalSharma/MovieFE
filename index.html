    <!--about the movie-->
    <p style="color: white;">
        Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is a Telugu-language epic action thriller directed by Prashanth Neel, starring
        Prabhas as Devaratha “Deva” Raisaar and Prithviraj Sukumaran as Vardha Raja Mannar. The film is set in the
        dystopian city-state of Khansaar, where monarchy prevails. In 1985, Deva and Vardha share a close bond, but a
        violent attack on Deva and his mother forces them into exile. Vardha sacrifices his territory to save Deva’s
        life, establishing a debt of loyalty that Deva vows to honor. The story spans multiple timelines, blending past
        tribal conflicts with present-day political power struggles.

        Years later, Deva is living a quiet life with his mother when he is drawn back into Khansaar by Vardha’s call
        for help. A series of events involving kidnappings, political conspiracies, and clashes with ruthless
        mercenaries force Deva to confront powerful enemies. He rescues Aadhya, the daughter of an NRI, and faces
        opposition from both the ruling Mannar family and rival tribes. During the conflict, Deva proves his strength
        and loyalty, taking down powerful foes, including Ghaniyaar and Mannar allies who threaten Vardha’s claim to
        leadership.

        The film delves into Khansaar’s history, revealing tribal wars, betrayals, and the rise of Raja Mannar, who
        exterminates the Shouryaanga tribe to secure his dominance. Deva is eventually revealed as the surviving heir of
        the Shouryaanga tribe and rightful successor to Khansaar’s throne. Vardha, despite losing territory, recognizes
        Deva’s power and appoints him as the “Salaar,” cementing his position as a formidable warrior and protector. The
        film balances intense action sequences with political drama, showcasing both personal loyalty and large-scale
        tribal conflicts.

        Released on 22 December 2023, Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire was praised for its high-octane action, grand
        production design, and the performances of Prabhas and Prithviraj. Music by Ravi Basrur and cinematography by
        Bhuvan Gowda contributed to its immersive experience. The film became a commercial success, earning over
        ₹614–702 crore worldwide. With a sequel, Salaar: Part 2 – Shouryaanga Parvam, already announced for 2026, the
        story promises to explore the next chapter of Deva’s rise and the continuing power struggles in Khansaar.

            cinematographers and music directors like Ravi Basrur, have resulted in visually striking and musically
            memorable films. With Salaar, he continues to push the boundaries of action cinema, cementing his place as
